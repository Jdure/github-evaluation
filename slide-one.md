# GitHub Training Evaluation

This is a review of two learning paths found in [GitHub's Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths).



## Purpose

The following questions will be answered: 
  - How long does each course take?
  - Which parts are appropriate for which roles?
  
Note: This will only appear in the speaker notes window.



## Courses explained

GitHub's Learning Lab provides two main introductory courses to understand the workflow process of GitHub.
Each section requires the team member to read about the topic at hand and complete a task.


### First Course

The entire **First day of GitHub** learning path takes approximately 1.5 hours to complete. Teaches basics of GitHub such as:
  - commits
  - branching
  - issues
  - pull requests


### Second Course

The second learning path **First week on GitHub** is more indept and takes 2 hours to complete. Teaches complex concepts such as :
  - github pages
  - managing merge conflicts
  - reviewing pull requests 
  - securing your workflows



## Learning Paths
  
The goal of this evaluation is to prioritize the courses that are compatible with each team member's role. 
In the next slides we will discuss which course are meant for each member and why.




### All Members

The following course should be taken by all members.

  - [Discover GitHub Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY&feature=youtu.be) (video)<sup>1</sup>
  - Introduction to GitHub course<sup>2</sup>

  
Note: First two items are found in **First day of GitHub** Learning Path; last item is found in **First Week on GitHub** Learning Path


### Why

1. The videos give a clear overview of GitHub and GitHub pages. 
2. The course is a explanation and walkthrough on GitHub basic concepts.




### Team Researchers

The following course should be taken by all team researchers. 
  - Git handbook<sup>1</sup>
  - Communicating using Markdowns<sup>1</sup>
  - Uploading your project to GitHub<sup>2</sup>
  - GitHub Pages<sup>3</sup>
  - Managing merge conflicts<sup>4</sup>
  - Securing your workflows<sup>5</sup>
  


### Why

1. Invaluables tools when working with Git and GitHub
2. A how to plan in deploying your projects
3. Demontrates how to host your project on GitHub 
4. Important when working on the same file on two different branches
5. How to manage vulnerable dependencies and prevent exposing sensitive data




### Team Lead

The following course should be taken by all team leads.
  - Git Handbook<sup>1</sup>
  - Uploading your project to GitHub<sup>2</sup>
  - Reviewing pull requests<sup>3</sup>
  - Managing merge conflicts<sup>4</sup>
  - Securing your workflows<sup>5</sup>


  
### Why

1. Necessary when working with Git and GitHub
2. A how to plan in deploying your project
3. Request reviews, review someone's code, respond to reviews and approve pull requests.  
4. Important when working on the same file on two different branches
5. How to manage vulnerable dependencies and prevent exposing sensitive data




### Manager

Managers can part-take in the other courses. They're priority should be the **reviewing pull requests** course.


### Why

For quality insurance, and have an overview of the project. Along with requesting reviews, reviewing someone's code, responding to reviews and approving pull requests.




## CI/CD

GitHub training lab provides a course, which is not in the learning path on [Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/continuous-integration-with-travis-ci)
This course helps setup tool to ensure quality software development. 


## Who would this course benefit
This course would benefit the team researchers and team leads. Since it would help them :
  - setup CI in their existing repositories
  - create build and test environments
  - enables protected branches
  - automated validations is added to the project
