## Continuous Improvement
A review of our mob programming experience to improve on a fundational software development approach.



## Key aspects

Here are some highlights of the Mob programming experiment. 

Some highlights: 
  - Open communication
  - Guidance
  - Problem-solve
  - Learn by doing
  - Shadowing



## Open Communication

Mob programming is a collaborative approach; ideas are exchanged and techniques are shared.



## Guidance

Ideally, the approach is structured to help individual developpers to work on specific tasks to help the project.



## Problem Solve

It's common for developers to get stuck writing code. With a set of peers with different levels of experience, those down times are less frequent.



## Learn by doing

Developpers can improve their knowledge and skills easly with mob programming.



## Shadowing

Being able to learn from more experienced developpers is important to improve the knowledge base of the team.



## Next Steps

The experiment was done with four members of the team. For what it's worth the experiement was a success. To improve on this approach we can: 

  1. Add more members of the team to work on a project (hack-a-thon style) 
  2. Incorporate less technical individuals to improve their skill
  3. Figure out how to incorporate mob programming to a virtual team
