## Continuous Improvement
A review of our **mob programming** experiment.


## What is it?

Some words... 


## Purpose

To increase productivity, decision making and output of a project. 



## Key findings

  - Open communication
  - Guidance
  - Problem-solve
  - Learn by doing
  - Shadowing


## Open Communication

Mob programming is a collaborative approach; ideas are exchanged and techniques are shared.


## Guidance

The experiment made developpers work on specific tasks to build the project.


## Problem Solve

It's common for developers to be stuck writing code. Peers make those down times less frequent.


## Learn by doing

Developpers can improve their abilities with mob programming.


## Shadowing

Experienced developpers will improve the knowledge base of the team.



## Next Steps

  1. Add members to work on a bigger project 
  2. Incorporate individuals to improve their skill
  3. Define a use case for a virtual team
