## GitHub Training Evaluation

This is a review of two learning paths found in [GitHub's Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths).



## Purpose

The following questions will be answered: 
  - The lenght to complete each course
  - Specify a set of courses for each team member
  
Note: This will only appear in the speaker notes window.



## Learning Paths

GitHub's Learning Lab provides two main paths to understand the workflow process of GitHub.
Each section requires the team member to read about the topic and complete a task.


### First Course

The **First day of GitHub** learning path takes approximately 1.5 hours to complete. Teaches basics of GitHub such as:
  - commits
  - branching
  - issues
  - pull requests


### Second Course

The second learning path **First week on GitHub** is more indept and takes 2 hours to complete. Teaches complex concepts such as :
  - github pages
  - managing merge conflicts
  - reviewing pull requests 
  - securing your workflows



## Courses explained
  
The goal of this evaluation is to prioritize the courses that are compatible with each team member's role. 
In the next slides we will discuss which courses are meant for each member and why.




### All Members

The following courses should be taken by all members. 
  - [What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E&feature=youtu.be) (video)<sup>1</sup>
  - [Discover GitHub Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY&feature=youtu.be) (video)<sup>1</sup>
  - Introduction to GitHub course<sup>2</sup>

  
Note: First two items are found in **First day of GitHub** Learning Path; last item is found in **First Week on GitHub** Learning Path


### Why

1. The videos give a clear overview of GitHub and GitHub pages. 
2. The course is a explanation and walkthrough on GitHub basic concepts.




### Team Researchers

The following courses should be taken by all team researchers. 
  - Git handbook<sup>1</sup>
  - Communicating using Markdowns<sup>1</sup>
  - Uploading your project to GitHub<sup>2</sup>
  - GitHub Pages<sup>3</sup>
  - Managing merge conflicts<sup>4</sup>
  - Securing your workflows<sup>5</sup>
  


### Why

1. Invaluables tools when working with Git and GitHub
2. A plan for deploying your project
3. Guide to host your project on GitHub 
4. Avoids branching mistakes between collaborators
5. Manage vulnerable dependencies and prevent exposing sensitive data




### Team Lead

The following courses should be taken by all team leads.
  - Git Handbook<sup>1</sup>
  - Uploading your project to GitHub<sup>2</sup>
  - Reviewing pull requests<sup>3</sup>
  - Managing merge conflicts<sup>4</sup>
  - Securing your workflows<sup>5</sup>


  
### Why

1. Necessary when working with Git and GitHub
2. A plan for deploying your project
3. Request reviews, review someone's code and approve pull requests.  
4. Avoids branching mistakes between collaborators 
5. Manage vulnerable dependencies and prevent exposing sensitive data




### Manager

Managers can part-take in the other courses. They're priority should be the **reviewing pull requests** course.


### Why

For quality insurance, managers could request reviews, review someone's code, respond to reviews and approve pull requests.




### CI/CD

GitHub training lab provides a course, which is not in the learning path on [Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/continuous-integration-with-travis-ci).
This course helps setup tool to ensure quality software development. 


### Who would this course benefit
This course would benefit the team researchers and team leads. Since it would help them :
  - setup CI in their existing repositories
  - create build and test environments
  - enables protected branches
  - automate validations within the project



### Summary
  - The Learning Paths take between 1.5 to 2 hours to complete.
  - Each team member has a series of courses they should prioritize
  - CI/CD learning, necessary for projects that require software development
