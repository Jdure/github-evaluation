## Continuous Improvement
A review of our **mob programming** experiment.



## Purpose

To increase productivity, decision making and output of a project.



## Key findings

  - Open communication
  - Guidance
  - Problem-solve
  - Learn by doing
  - Shadowing


## Open Communication

Mob programming is a collaborative approach; ideas are exchanged and techniques are shared.


## Guidance

The experiment made developpers work on specific tasks to help the project.


## Problem Solve

It's common for developers to be stuck writing code. Peers make those down times less frequent.


## Learn by doing

Developpers can improve their knowledge and skills easly with mob programming.


## Shadowing

Experienced developpers is important to improve the knowledge base of the team.



## Next Steps

To improve on this approach we can: 

  1.Add members to work on a bigger project 
  2.Incorporate individuals to improve their skill
  3.Define a use case for a virtual team
