## GitHub Training Evaluation

This is a review of two learning paths found in [GitHub's Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths).



## Purpose

The goal of this evaluation is to match each course to a team member. 

These questions will be answered: 
  - Time to complete each course
  - Match courses to each team member
  
Note: This will only appear in the speaker notes window.




## Learning Paths

GitHub's Learning Lab has two paths to teach the workflow process of GitHub.


### First Course

The **First day of GitHub** takes 1.5 hours to complete. Teaches basics of GitHub like:
  - commits
  - branching
  - issues
  - pull requests


### Second Course

**First week on GitHub** takes 2 hours to complete. Teaches complex concepts like:
  - github pages
  - managing merge conflicts
  - reviewing pull requests 
  - securing your workflows




### Team

These courses should be taken by all members. 
  - [What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E&feature=youtu.be) (video)<sup>1</sup>
  - [Discover GitHub Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY&feature=youtu.be) (video)<sup>1</sup>
  - Introduction to GitHub course<sup>2</sup>

  
Note: First two items are found in **First day of GitHub** Learning Path; last item is found in **First Week on GitHub** Learning Path


### Why

1. The videos give a clear overview of GitHub and GitHub pages. 
2. The course is a explanation and walkthrough on GitHub basic concepts.




### Team

### Team Researchers

Theese courses should be taken by all team researchers. 
  - Git handbook<sup>1</sup>
  - Communicating using Markdowns<sup>1</sup>
  - Uploading your project to GitHub<sup>2</sup>
  - GitHub Pages<sup>3</sup>
  - Managing merge conflicts<sup>4</sup>
  - Securing your workflows<sup>5</sup>
  


### Why

1. Invaluables tools to work with Git and GitHub
2. A plan to deploy your project
3. Guide to host your project on GitHub 
4. Avoids branch mistakes between collaborators
5. Manage vulnerable dependencies and hide sensitive data




### Team Lead

These courses should be taken by all team leads.
  - Git Handbook<sup>1</sup>
  - Uploading your project to GitHub<sup>2</sup>
  - Reviewing pull requests<sup>3</sup>
  - Managing merge conflicts<sup>4</sup>
  - Securing your workflows<sup>5</sup>


  
### Why

1. Necessary to work with Git and GitHub
2. A plan to deploy your project
3. Request reviews, review someone's code and approve pull requests.  
4. Avoids branch mistakes between collaborators 
5. Manage vulnerable dependencies and hide sensitive data




### Manager

Managers can part-take in the other courses. They're priority should be the **reviewing pull requests** course.


### Why

For quality insurance, managers could request reviews, review someone's code, respond to reviews and approve pull requests.




### CI/CD

GitHub training lab provides a course, which is not in the learning path on [Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/continuous-integration-with-travis-ci).
This course helps setup tool to ensure quality software development. 


### Who would this course benefit
This course would benefit the team researchers and team leads. Since it would help them :
  - setup CI in their existing repositories
  - create build and test environments
  - enables protected branches
  - automate validations within the project



### Summary
  - The Learning Paths take between 1.5 to 2 hours to complete.
  - Each team member has a series of courses they should prioritize
  - CI/CD learning, necessary for software development projects
