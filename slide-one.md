## GitHub Training Evaluation

This is a review of GitHub Training from [GitHub's Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths).



## Purpose

The goal of this evaluation is to match each course to a team member. 

These questions will be answered: 
  - Time to complete each course
  - Match course to team member



## Learning Paths

GitHub's Learning Lab has two paths to teach the workflow process of GitHub.


### First Path

The **First day of GitHub** takes 1.5 hours to complete. Teaches basics of GitHub like:
  - commits
  - branching
  - issues
  - pull requests


### Second Path

**First week on GitHub** takes 2 hours to complete. Teaches complex concepts like:
  - github pages
  - managing merge conflicts
  - reviewing pull requests 
  - securing your workflows




## The Team

Instead of following a learning path, members should focus on assigned courses.

## CI/CD

GitHub training lab provides a course, which is not in the learning path, on [Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/continuous-integration-with-travis-ci).
This course helps setup the tool to ensure quality software development. 


### Who should follow this course
This course would benefit the **team researchers** and **team leads**. Since it would help them :
